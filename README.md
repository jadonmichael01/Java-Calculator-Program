# Java-Calculator-Program

Implemented a simple calculator supporting integer values with only two operations addition and subtraction. The program receives an expression like 95 âˆ’ (12 + 33) from the keyboard and prints out the result (50 in this case) on the screen.

My program uses the stack data structure (like java.util.Stack) to store the intermediate results of inner parentheses and/or the operators.
